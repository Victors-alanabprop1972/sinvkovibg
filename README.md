OMG okay so wow, just, like, WOW. Just walked out of The Ballad of Wallis Island and my brain is like a messy ball of yarn — you know when a cat just totally destroys it and it's everywhere? That’s me right now. Sitting here on this shady park bench that smells oddly of pickles (????) and my back, oh my god, my back, it’s killing me from those crappy theater seats, you know? Should have 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   instead ugh.

Okay, okay, so the  !! First of all, the colors!! It was like someone threw a rainbow through a kaleidoscope and it landed in a Bingo Hall. You remember that one scene where the sunset looked like peach sorbet was melting over everything? My popcorn bowl got 10% fuller at that—kudos to the CGI guys or whatever, seriously. 

And then there’s Wallis, wow. What even! His character was like a Shakespearean jellyfish trying to figure out life on a Saturday morning. That dinner scene??? The confusion was real, man. Like, you could feel the heat from the kitchen, or maybe it was just the dude next to me sweating from the 3D glasses. But honestly, his story arc made me feel like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a soap opera on a rollercoaster. I’m still dizzy haha!

> There was this bit where the birds started to sing, and it just reminded me of this one time at a karaoke bar where they played J-pop for hours. You get what I'm saying? The audio was just, woosh, like waves, but with a beat. I kind of started to hear it in this rhythm in my head, pop past its expiration date but still spicy, ya know? Soundtrack goals, majorly.

But oh man, the dialogue was bananas, had me thinking about cereal mascots on vacation. The kind of lines where you're like, wait, did they just, like, eat the script and spit it out like conversational confetti? That’s the good stuff there, raw and strange. I should totally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again with 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s, just to catch all that jazz.

Ugh, if I could rewind the scene where the blue parrot steals Wallis’s hat and flies into the sunset, I think my heart grew three sizes, or maybe it was the bag of Skittles. But seriously, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you can, just relive that genius nonsense. 

Here’s me, rambling like a raccoon high on marshmallows, but seriously, go see it. Let’s debrief when I’m less of a festival of thoughts and more like a PowerPoint presentation, haha! Okay, snap out of it.

This part is mostly useless, just like my 9th grade science journal.
